// A timer queue which allows events to be scheduled for execution
// at some later point. Reasons you might want to use this implementation
// instead of some other are:
//
// - A single-file C++11 implementation with no external dependencies.
// - Optimized for high occupancy rates, on the assumption that the
//   utilization of the timer queue is proportional to the utilization
//   of the system as a whole. When a tradeoff needs to be made
//   between efficiency of one operation at a low occupancy rate and
//   another operation at a high rate, we choose the latter.
// - Tries to minimize the cost of event rescheduling or cancelation,
//   on the assumption that a large percentage of events will never
//   be triggered. The implementation avoids unnecessary work when an
//   event is rescheduled, and provides a way for the user specify a
//   range of acceptable execution times instead of just an exact one.
// - Facility for limiting the number of events to execute on a
//   single invocation, to allow fine grained interleaving of timer
//   processing and application logic.
// - An interface that at least the author finds convenient.
//
// The exact implementation strategy is a hierarchical timer
// wheel. A timer wheel is effectively a ring buffer of linked lists
// of events, and a pointer to the ring buffer. As the time advances,
// the pointer moves forward, and any events in the ring buffer slots
// that the pointer passed will get executed.
//
// A hierarchical timer wheel layers multiple timer wheels running at
// different resolutions on top of each other. When an event is
// scheduled so far in the future than it does not fit the innermost
// (core) wheel, it instead gets scheduled on one of the outer
// wheels. On each rotation of the inner wheel, one slot's worth of
// events are promoted from the second wheel to the core. On each
// rotation of the second wheel, one slot's worth of events is
// promoted from the third wheel to the second, and so on.
//
// The basic usage is to create a single TimerWheel object and
// multiple TimerEvent or MemberTimerEvent objects. The events are
// scheduled for execution using TimerWheel::schedule() or
// TimerWheel::schedule_in_range(), or unscheduled using the event's
// cancel() method.
//
// Example usage:
//
//      typedef std::function<void()> Callback;
//      TimerWheel timers;
//      int count = 0;
//      TimerEvent<Callback> timer([&count] () { ++count; });
//
//      timers.schedule(&timer, 5);
//      timers.advance(4);
//      assert(count == 0);
//      timers.advance(1);
//      assert(count == 1);
//
//      timers.schedule(&timer, 5);
//      timer.cancel();
//      timers.advance(4);
//      assert(count == 1);
//
// To tie events to specific member functions of an object instead of
// a callback function, use MemberTimerEvent instead of TimerEvent.
// For example:
//
//      class Test {
//        public:
//            Test() : inc_timer_(this) {
//            }
//            void start(TimerWheel* timers) {
//                timers->schedule(&inc_timer_, 10);
//            }
//            void on_inc() {
//                count_++;
//            }
//            int count() { return count_; }
//        private:
//            MemberTimerEvent<Test, &Test::on_inc> inc_timer_;
//            int count_ = 0;
//      };
